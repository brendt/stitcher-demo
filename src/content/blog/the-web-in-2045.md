On August 6 1991, Sir Tim Berners-Lee put online the first website ever.
27 years have past since that first website was reachable via the world wide web.
With the massive progression we've seen in the web world these past years, 
I wonder where we'll be 27 years in the future, what the web will look like in 2045.

## A brief history

What better way to look at the future, than to look at the past?
There's an excellent blog called "[The History Of The Web](*https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/archives/)".
Thanks to Jay Hoffman, the writer of the blog; 
I've been fascinated by the roots of the web. For example:

On **August 6, 1991** Tim Berners-Lee puts online the first website.
Only a few months later, on **October 29** of the same year, 
the first HTML draft is posted on the www-talk mailing list.

Three years went by when Netscape Navigator, the most popular browser of that time, 
was released on **October 13, 1994**. 
It took Microsoft almost a year longer to release their browser, Internet Explorer 1; 
on **August 15 of 1995**. 
And in **December of 1996**, the first iteration for CSS was conceptualised.

Mozilla released Firefox more than ten years after the beginning of the web in **2004**.
Only a few years later, Apple flipped the web on its mobile side 
by presenting the very first iPhone on **January 8, 2007**.

Twenty-three years after the first mention of HTML, 
modern websites found their identity as we know it today, 
when HTML5 was made to formal recommendation by the W3C on **October 28, 2014**. 

It's amazing to see how the web has evolved in less than three decades. 
Not only its technical boundaries were pushed;
people kept finding innovating ways for what the technology was used for.
Think about sites like GeoCities or NeoPets; the first blog post written in *1997*;
or some recent examples like [/r/place](*https://i.redd.it/agcbmqgjn14z.png) on Reddit 
and an experience beyond words crafted by [SB Nation](*https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football).

## Today

Technical: JS explosion, WASM, everything to run in the browser

Content: Social media, fake news, privacy

## 2045

Technical: the browser as a sandbox for everything?

Content: hope for no stagnation, artistic freedom
