On August 6 1991, Sir Tim Berners-Lee put online the first website ever.
27 years have past since that first website was reachable via the world wide web.
With the massive progression we've seen in the web world these past years, 
I wonder where we'll be 27 years in the future, what the web will look like in 2045.
